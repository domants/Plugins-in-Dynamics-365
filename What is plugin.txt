What is plugin?
-Class library or Set of Classes
-When you compile set of classes you get something called dll file or assembly file
-assembly file has a custom code in it and you're going to register that in server side event to run you're custom logic.


Plugin Pipeline:
-Pre Validation 
-Stage number(10)
->

-Pre Operation 
-Stage number(20)
->If you want to do some calculation, some logic before system saves the record inside it.

-Core Event (No plugins allowed) - Database transaction
-Stage number(30)

-Post Operation 
-Stage number(40)
->When you want to be this record to be save in the database and also when it has dependency like the ID of the primaryt entity you always register this in post operation.


-Pre-Entity Image
>>If you want to access field data before modification (Old data)
>>If you want to access some data of form that is not modified

Synchronous is like this - you complete one task, and then wait for the game to give you a response before moving on to the next task.


Now, imagine that the game has an option to complete tasks asynchronously. In this case, you can complete one task, and then move on to the next task without waiting for a response from the game. The game will give you the reward later, when it is ready.



synchronous plugins wait for a response from the system before moving on to the next step in the plugin execution process. This means that if the plugin needs to interact with external systems or perform long-running tasks, the plugin will block the execution process until the task is completed


Asynchronous plugins, on the other hand, allow the plugin to continue processing without waiting for a response from the system. This means that the system can continue executing other tasks while the plugin is performing its tasks
